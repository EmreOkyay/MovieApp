# MovieApp

This is a SpringWeb Application that's built with structural architecture which in the end will develop into a microservice architecture as development goes on. <br/><br/>
It uses SpringWeb as it's framework, Stream API, Jdbc as it's ORM and PostgreSql as it's dbms. <br/><br/>
It takes movie and director info and stores them in their corresponding tables in the database and creates a correlation between them. <br/><br/>
It can respond to variety of Api Endpoints and return/update various information. The microservice-like architecture also makes it easier to implement new functionalities when needed. <br/>

I'm currently working on this project with the help of my course teacher Oguz Karan. <br/> 
I'm trying to implement the things I learned from there in a seperate project in order to practice.
